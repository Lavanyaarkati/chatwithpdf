Project Description:
This project is designed to extract, process, and analyze text data from PDF documents and websites using Python. The system allows users to either upload a PDF file or enter a website URL and then perform keyword-based searches on the extracted content. It integrates fuzzy matching techniques to enhance search accuracy, making it useful for extracting insights from unstructured data.

Key Features:
âœ… PDF Data Extraction â€“ Uses pdfplumber to extract both text and tables from PDF files.
âœ… Web Scraping â€“ Utilizes BeautifulSoup to fetch and process content from web pages.
âœ… Text & Table Search â€“ Implements fuzzy matching (fuzzywuzzy) to identify closely related search terms.
âœ… Data Processing â€“ Cleans, structures, and formats extracted content for better readability.
âœ… Automation & Efficiency â€“ Speeds up data retrieval from large documents or websites.
